                <h4>Programming is magical.</h4>

                <p> Programming the crossroads of creativity and innovation. Beginning as a conceptual idea, programming allows you to translate ideas from the mind into concrete,  physical results.</p>
 
                <p>Therefore, whatever you dream of, you can create! You are the ultimate end result of your creation.</p>
 
                <h4>Programming is a metaphor for life.</h4>

                <p>Life has all sorts of obstacles and challenges. With programming, you can test many different options before coming to a conclusion to what works best. The same thing goes for life. There are my paths to choose and a lot of different directions to take. With programming you’re forced to make choice and in doing so, you can conquer decision paralysis.</p>
 
                <p>Programming is synonymous with life because with every decision you make, good or bad, you get to learn from your choices and build your experiences. </p>
 
                <p>In the end, it doesn’t matter if the choices were “right” or “wrong” but how far you have come from the beginning of your journey.</p>
